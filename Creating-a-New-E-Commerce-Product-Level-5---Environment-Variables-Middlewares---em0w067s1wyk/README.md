Imagine you are working as a back-end developer for an online store that sells various products. In this project, you will be working on a boilerplate code that contains an array of products in a JSON format. Each object in the array contains id, name, price and quantity of a product. Your task is to create a new route using the HTTP POST request method to add a new product to the data.

Features:

Create a new product using the HTTP POST request method.
Add the new product at the end of the products array in the JSON file and update the id accordingly.
Requirements:

You should create a new product by sending a POST request to the API endpoint /api/v1/products.
The product data should include name, price, and quantity.
The id for the new product should be automatically generated by incrementing the id of the last product in the array.
You should validate the product data before adding it to the products array.
If the product data is invalid, the API should return a 400 Bad Request status code along with an error message.
If the product is added successfully, the API should return a 201 Created status code along with the newly created product.
Database:

The project is using a JSON file to store the products data. The JSON file contains an array of objects, with each object representing a single product. The product objects have the following properties:

id: The unique identifier for the product.
name: The name of the product.
price: The price of the product.
quantity: The quantity of the product.
Folder Structure:

The project has the following folder structure:

data/products.json : Has an array of json objects, used as a mock data dump file.
app.js : Contains the route which needs to be implemented.
Response for different scenarios:

If the product data is valid and the product is added successfully, the API should return a 201 Created status code along with the newly created product.
If the product data is invalid, the API should return a 400 Bad Request status code along with an error message.
Routes and request parameters: The API endpoint for creating a new product is /api/v1/products. You should send a POST request to this endpoint with the product data in the request body.

Third Party Libraries: There are no third-party libraries required for this project.

Now that you have a clear understanding of the project requirements and guidelines, start by editing the ./src/app.js file to create the new product using the HTTP POST request method.

Examples:

Sample Input:

POST /api/v1/products/

{
    "name": "Headphones",
    "price": 50,
    "quantity": 10
}

Sample Output:

{
    "status": "Success",
    "message": "Product added successfully",
    "data": {
        "newProduct": {
            "id": 4,
            "name": "Headphones",
            "price": 50,
            "quantity": 10
        }
    }
}
